# The Formation of Sociology

Sociology as a discipline began in the mid 19th century, it was named by **Auguste Comte** who is also referred to as the **Father of Sociology**

There were 3 major ideas that lead to the beginning of the study of society

-   Industrial Revolution
-   Imperialism
-   Development of Natural Sciences (The Renaissance)

## Industrial Revolution

-   Industrial Revolution was a transition from Farming to that of Manufacturing which created **new avenues** for the middle class to be employed
-   This also came with the problem of **overcrowding in cities** due to mass migration from **rural to urban areas**
-   The control of rural agriculture by large landowners during this time acted as a push force while the growing employment opportunities were creating a pull force to the city
-   The cities in which these people lived were not equipped to hold these many residents and thus the workers had to live in dire poverty and in filthy crowded slums which were un-sanitized and unhealthy.
-   Their connections to their land and the connections to their family also were removed, and thus this became a ripe fertile land for radical social changes in society
-   This lead to the arousal of feelings of freedom equality and liberty and radical change, because these men and women now had nothing to loose, they had to force their children work and they themselves were forced to slog in inhabitable conditions. Democracy and individual rights saw very large traction during this time.

## Travel

-   Travel here refers to the travel of the European invaders through the world, they were met with several different cultures and traditions which they had to study and understand in order to take control of the people living in the lands they wished to colonize
-   Seeing these extreamly contrasting ways of life in Africa Asia and Latin America the Europeans were forced to ask why do cultures and traditions differ and what is the objective and need of these traditions that is one of the fundamental ideas of sociology

## Natural Sciences

-   Natural Science is also a very important field which helped build Sociology. The obsession with the Natural Sciences in the West began during the Renaissance with the Age of Enlightenment. During this period of time people were discovering how and why does nature act in a certain way. This curiosity also lead to the demolition of several superstitions prevalent in society at the time.
-   It also lead to the formation of the idea of a **Scientific Process** which was a set of rules and procedures that defined how nature would be studied and understood by these scientists which included **observation, experimentation, analysis and conclusion**
-   Thinkers like Auguste Comte tried to understand and study Society y
