# Absolutist View of The State

- The renaissance writers who have written about advice to the princes such as Machiavelli how a prince should act to maintain your ''Stat'' or state. Here it means your status
- Here the writers mention that in order to gain and maintain that status the princes must take care of the body of people or citizens that live in their jurisdiction
- The lack thereof would lead to a coup and the people would rise taking your ''status'' away 
* The Kings Two Bodies is a classic work again tracing the idea of the state in English Law discussions
	- He observed that they have 2 bodies, they have a normal body and the other is the official body of the head of the state
	- Skinner states this is the ***absolutist view of the state***
- Here developed 2 strands of absolutist vision 
	1. Here one view presents that it is not the people or the territory that makes the state but it is the people that are willing to act in submission to the single sovereign form the state
	2. The other view is that the Kings are appointed by God with complete power over their states, and the whole body of the state.
