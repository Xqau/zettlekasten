# Populist view of the State

* The main distinction of this idea is to remove the idea of the King being the Head of the State and the citizens being the body of the state. 
* It is also at the same time attacking the //absolutist// vision of what the state is
* Because it claims that the king is not the sovereign power but the people are themselves the source of the states sovereignty
* Another important ideas was put forward by Machiavelli who said that in order to live in a free state we must live in a free state. 
-  What he thus meant was that no one can be free if they are forced to conform to an arbitrary will either of the monarch or of any other ruler
-  Thus in order to be free we must be free to rule over selves, and that can only come through the idea of broad republicanism. Here we can see the populist side of Machiavelli argument
* The government or state is just a representative of the people and the people have complete power over it - Locke.
* The Vindication of Monarchy written during the French Religious wars moved from France to England leading to the fall of monarchy and the execution of the king.
* ''John Milton - Tenure of Kings'' - The sovereign power is vested into the people and that gives them power to remove the king that does not work for them.
