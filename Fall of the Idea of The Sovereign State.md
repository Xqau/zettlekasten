# Fall of the Idea of The Sovereign State

* The basic prevailing idea of sovereignty was to consider that it meant to command without being commanded 
* Gradually people started to see that if this is the idea of sovereignty then States are not sovereign
* 1920 we come to the idea of the decline of the idea of the sovereign state and creation of the //world state//
* As we can see that the International Organisations, MNC's etc are able to coerce the State into doing what they want, and thus leading to the fall of the sovereign state especially in the developing countries
