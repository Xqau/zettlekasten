# Attack on the Person of the State

* This idea of the State being a person was the founding idea of International Law but during the formation of ''Classical Utilitarianism '' we can see the rise of thinkers like Bentham and Austin who consider the entire idea of State and of the Person of the State to be completely and utterly meaningless.
* Many utilitarian thinkers don't even mention the idea of State because they think that its just fiction and according to utilitarian jurisprudence fiction has no place in Law
* Austin also talks about the State in his publication ''Lectures on Jurisprudence'' by saying that the State is just the bearer of the Sovereign power and thus the State and the Sovereign are the same
* He thus comes to the modern view of the idea of State today referrers to the Government 

## Hegelian Thought

* Hegelian thinkers suggest that there is a person called as state and he is firstly ''distinct from other institutions like the sovereign''
* Secondly they also say that the State is not a fictional being ''it is a real person, and it represents the rationality of the people''. Which then means to say that if //you// are rational you must follow the state
* The distinction here from Hobbes here is that there is a clear understanding of the State as a real person thus making it different from Hobbes who says it is a fictional character
