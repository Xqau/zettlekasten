# The Person of the State

 ## Attack on Populist Theory

* 2 types of attacks 
	1. Many authors post the populist theory go back to the idea of the divine rights of the king attacking this people centrist approach to the state
	2. Hobbes :
		1. In Leviathan Hobbes states that the people cannot be sovereign, because in the beginning there was no society. And if there was no society then there is no such thing as a body of the people and its all a construction
		2. Why was there no society, because human behavior by default is not to be social, it is asocial by default and thus it is a constant state of war
		3. At the same time Hobbes is also against the Divine Rights theory, he considers monarchs to be just representatives of the people. 
		4. He was of the idea that there is no lawful authority until you explicitly consent to his or her power over you. 
		5. A sovereign is just an authorized representative, a representative is one that you have consented to speak in your name, and this representative needs to be authorized explicitly
		6. ''Idea of Political Covenant'' : there is a covenant between the people as to choose and designate someone to be our representative
		7. But the implication here is that earlier you were a multitude of different individuals but now after the covenant you have become one. Thus you have one will as the kings will is now yours as you have allowed the king to speak in your name 
		8. This also means that all of the people are one person, because they have same choices the same will and represented by the same person. The sovereign (king) thus is the ''authorized representative'' of the Person of the State 
		9. This person is not real but he is artificially eternal and is represented by the Sovereign and the duty of the Sovereign is to ''maintain the good of the person of state ie to maintain common good''
		10. Gradually in subsequent publications by other authors they have come back to Hobbes idea of the person of the State and considered the state to be a Moral Person who is represented by the Sovereign with the aim of promoting the farewell of this person which means the common good
