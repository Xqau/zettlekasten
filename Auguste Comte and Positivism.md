# Auguste Comte and Positivism

## Auguste Comte
- Also called as the Father of Sociology
- Born in a small peasant town in France and moved to Paris during the volatile period of the French Revolution (**1798-1857**)
- The changes that he saw in the French Society during that time was important in his inquiries into **Social Change (Social Dynamics)** and **Social Order (Social Static)**
- He thus raised fundamental questions as to why do certain societies stick together and why do some experiance change
- He thought of solving these questions through the idea of **scientific methodology** which includes experimentation, observation analysis and finally a conclusion. 
- This is why the developement of the natural sciences is also an important part of the [[Developement of Sociology]] as a decipline
- He was a proponent of creating a society on the basis of science and industry rather than on religion and feudal relations
- He thus finally in 1838 creates the decipline called Sociology or the *Study of Society*
- His idea was to have social scientists use the scientific process to find out about the society and talk to people about **how one must ought to live his life** and thus **cure social chaos**

### Positivism
Positivism in Sociology is one of those ideas which has been attributed to Auguste, which sees the world as is. This approach is greatly dependent on the data that is present and can be fact checked. 
- One of the common sayings regarding a positivist is "If a positivist sees a black sheep on a meadow he will not say that he sees a black sheep, he will say he sees a sheep whose one side is black"
- This is because he does not know about the other side, and because that is something that is not observable it is not reliable data which is why it cannot be used. There is no space for the assumption of data
